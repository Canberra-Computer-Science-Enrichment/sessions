This makes life much easier for anyone trying to access your information or steal your stuff!\n",

Obviously, the system wants to somehow check you've entered the correct one. Perhaps it could check it against a stored copy of the correct password. But then your password would need to be saved somewhere, just waiting for someone to find and read it! Worse, if you were logging into something online, this would mean sending your password over the internet making it very easy for an adversary to spot it.\n",

    "   * `?l = abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz`\n",
    "   * `?u = ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ`\n",
    "   * `?d = 0123456789`\n",

    "   * `?a = ?l?u?d?s`\n",
    "   * `?b = 0x00 - 0xff`\n",
    "\n",
    "So for example, if you knew you were looking for a PIN of length 4, the command you would enter is `?d?d?d?d`. If you knew you were looking for a five letter name starting with a capital, then a year, you'd enter `?u?l?l?l?d?d?d?d`.\n",

    "The advice includes\n",
    "  * Think of a passphrase that is made up of at least four words, including at least 13 characters, for example 'horsecupstarshoe'. Make it meaningful to you so it is easy to remember.\n",
    "  * Install a password manager on your computer, smartphone or tablet. It will generate and remember secure passwords for you and some password managers will sync across your devices.\n",
    "  * Use two-factor authentication.\n",
    "  * Don't use the same password for multiple services or websites.\n",
    "  * Use password tiers- unique and complex passwords for high risk accounts such as online shopping or social media, and less complex ones for low risk ones such as newsletters.\n",
    "  * Never give your password to anyone, ever!\n",
