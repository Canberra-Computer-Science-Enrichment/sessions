    "\n",
    "This notebook simulates  dynamic earthquake ruptures and elastic wave propagation in one space dimensions (1D). Spontaneously propagating shear ruptures on a frictional interface in an elastic solid is a useful idealization of natural earthquakes. The conditions relating slip-rate and fault strength are often expressed as nonlinear friction laws.\n",
    "\n",
    "During an earthquake, two sides of the fault, initially held in contact by a high level of frictional resistance, slip suddenly when that resistance catastrophically decreases, generating strong ground shaking which is carried by seismic waves to remote areas, far away from fault zones\n",

    "\n",
    "Slip weakening friction describes a friction behavior in which friction coefficient weakens linearly with slip.  When the fault is at rest the friction coefficient is denoted by static friction coefficient ${f_s}$, when the fault is in motion the friction coefficient is denoted by the dynamic friction coefficient ${f_d}$. An earthquake begins when the load $\\tau$ at a finite patch on the fault overcomes the peak frictional strength, $\\tau > \\tau_p$, ${\\quad \\tau_p = f_s \\cdot \\sigma_n}$.  As the earthquake continues the fault surfaces slide relative to each other  and the frictional coefficient evolves from linearly from static friction coefficient $f_s$  to the dynamic friction coefficient ${f_d}$. The fault is fully weakened when the slip reaches the critical slip ${D_c}$. This can be seen in the figure below which plots the friction coefficient as a function of slip.\n",

    "#### Rate and State Friction\n",
    "\n",
    "[Fast velocity laboratory friction experiments](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-N38H5aicM)\n",
    "\n",
    "Rate and state friction is a constitutive law that was empirically found and is considered more realistic than slip weakening. It takes the form:  \n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    " &\\tau = \\sigma_n \\cdot f(V, \\theta), \\quad f(V, \\theta) = [ f_0 + a \\cdot ln(\\frac {V}{V_0}) + b \\cdot ln( \\frac{V_0 \\theta}{D_c})], \\\\\n",

    " \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src= Rate_and_State.png>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this equation ${V}$ is the current slip velocity and ${V_0}$ is a reference slip velocity while ${f_0}$ is the steady state friction coefficient at the reference velocity: ${f_{V= V_0}}$. There is the state variable ${\\theta}$, and the state evolution law $G(V, \\theta)$. We consider specifically the aging law: ${ G(V, \\theta) = 1 - \\frac {V\\theta }{D_c}.\\quad}$ At steady state the state variable is proportional to the critical distance divided by velocity ${ \\theta_{ss} = \\frac {D_c}{V}}$  <br/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Here ${a}$ is the *direct effect* and is used to model how the system responds to velocity changes. ${b}$ is the *evolution effect* and describes the magnitude of the steady state friction.  ${D_c}$ is the critical distance and corresponds to the slip length over which the evolution of ${a \\to b}$ occurs. The relationship of ${a}$ and ${b}$ to the slip weakening friction variables is as follows: ${\\quad b = \\frac {df_s}{d(ln(t))} \\quad, \\quad (a-b) = \\frac {df_d}{d(ln(V))} \\quad}$ where ${t}$ is the amount of time of contact without an earthquake. It is interesting to notice that there is a relationship between slip velocity ${V}$ and dynamic friction ${f_d}$ that depends on the difference ${(a-b)}$. If ${(a-b)>0}$ it shows that there is a velocity strengthening relationship ${\\frac {df_d}{d(ln(V))} > 0}$. Any rupture that enters this region will arrest and is called a *stable* region. If ${(a-b)<0}$ it shows that there is a velocity weakening relationship ${\\frac {df_d}{d(ln(V))} < 0}$, this is where earthquakes can nucleate and grow and is called *unstable*. On the border between *stable* and *unstable* regions is a zone of *conditional stability* where ruptures can sustain propagation while not growing or terminating. This notebook only exists in the unstable zone.\n",

    "The equations are discretized using the SBP-SAT finite difference scheme. Time integration is performed using the classical fourth order accurate Runge-Kutta method. For more elaborate discussions, we refer the reader to the references and the  notebooks on the SBP-SAT method. A summary of the numerical implementations used in the this notebook is presentated in the flow-chart below.\n",

    "\n",
    "In the parameter window you can modulate the material properties, run time, domain size, and CFL criterion. In addition, you can choose rate and state friction or slip weakening friction, notice the differences that occur with this choice. In the Calculations and plotting cell the resulting on fault tractions and slip velocities are solved for in the time_integrator.elastic_RK4 function, which also calls on the other associated functions. The bottom cell contains 5 output plots of the rupture behavior.  \n",
